# HACKmty-2023
## Coach financiero: BanCoach

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help the community understand the available investment funds and how they can invest in them. The problem identified is that people don’t have a lot of knowledge about investments and mostly think of them as something mostly available for the professionals and the very wealthy.

In Mexico, only 1% of the active financial individuals have investments, meaning that there is a significant opportunity to help many people learn about them, and what are the best options when considering their objectives. Helping people invest is beneficial because it implies economic growth as well as a way to maintain acquisition power when faced with inflation.

### What is BanCoach?
The platform works as a finance coach which gives recommendations to users based on their context and needs. The recommendations are based on the investment funds available by Banorte and their associated information: the recommendations levels are established using OpenAi’s completions API. In addition, the application also includes a chatbot which can be used to answer specific questions related to finance and/or the suggested investment funds.
